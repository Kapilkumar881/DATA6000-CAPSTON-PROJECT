# DATA6000-CAPSTON-PROJECT
Executive Summary
Demand and supply balance in the energy and utilities industry, and especially the electricity sector, is a challenge, particularly in view of increasing use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro. To optimize the grid operations and provide a reliable energy supply, appropriate planning and accurate forecasting as well as effective load management are important. The three key problems that are addressed in this report are: predicting hourly electricity consumption, understanding the seasonal behavior of renewable energy sources, and classifying peak load hours. In doing so, we will take advantage of data driven models with data sets of electricity consumption, renewable energy production, and load pricing. Forecasting will be done from ARIMA and VAR model while peak load hours picking will be done with the help of classification models like logistic regression and random forest. The evaluation will be done with the parameters like MAE, RMSE and F1 Score and will be visualized using Tableau. The purpose of this approach is to increase grid stability, control renewable energy and optimize energy distribution.
